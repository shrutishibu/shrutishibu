# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi there! I'm Shruti Shibu<br>Welcome to my GitHub profile!<br><br>üìö I‚Äôm a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Business Systems (CGPA 9.4), deeply passionate about software development and the art of building solutions that truly make an impact.<br><br>üíª Over my academic journey, I‚Äôve built a strong foundation in programming, data structures, databases, and problem-solving. What excites me most is the process of turning abstract ideas into real, working applications ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs developing projects that simplify everyday tasks, experimenting with new tools and frameworks, or collaborating on team-driven solutions.<br><br>‚ú® My unique background in both technology and business gives me an edge: I can see the bigger picture while also diving into the details of coding and implementation. This helps me think not just about how to build something, but also why it matters.<br><br>üå± Beyond academics, I‚Äôm a curious learner and a creative soul. Reading, dancing, and drawing fuel my imagination, and I often find that creativity feeds directly into my coding ‚Äî helping me think outside the box.<br><br>üöÄ I aspire to grow into a well-rounded software engineer, continuously learning, adapting, and contributing to projects that push boundaries and create value. I‚Äôm always open to collaborating, sharing ideas, and connecting with like-minded professionals who are as excited about tech as I am.<br><br>Let‚Äôs connect ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to exchange thoughts on technology, career journeys, or even just book recommendations!
