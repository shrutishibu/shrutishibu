🚀 Here on GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from web development to data science experiments. I'm always eager to collaborate on interesting projects and learn from the vibrant community of developers.

📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me diving into a good book, sketching out new ideas, or dancing to my favorite tunes. These activities not only help me relax but also inspire my coding adventures.

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat about tech, books, or anything else! Let's connect and create something amazing together. 😊
